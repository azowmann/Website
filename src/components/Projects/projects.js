                      <li>Mimicked the standard locked screen version of iPhoneâ€™s calculator app. Created an environment similar to the iPhone app, allowing for familiarity among most iOS users.</li>

                      <li>Implemented a dynamic contact form, allowing users of the website to efficiently send messages to me via email.</li>

                      <li>Developed a Google Chrome extension that retrieves a macronutrient of choice (calories, fats, carbohydrates, proteins) of the food by user input through API Ninjas Nutrition API. This extension makes finding general information on foods faster and more accessible. </li>
                      <li>Sampled by five peers of mine to test functionality. It is found useful often for those who meal-prep, and those with specific nutrition goals, as the fast retrieval of information makes it easy to know exactly what to shop for. </li>
